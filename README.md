The Page object model framework is used with Specflow using Gherkin form to enable BDD in the Project.

The Code is currently configured to run in  Chrome Browser only.

The code is written in Visual Studio 2019 and using the latest Support Libraries.

The Location can be changed from the Examples section in the feature file.

The Dates are dynamic and User just need to pass the number of months from today's day to Search the Hotels which means Date would change everyday depending on Current day the script is ran.

The framework contains only the basic actions which was required to complete the solution. We can even add the Extent reports and hooks for better visibility & maintenance.

A short video is included with the Project as a Demo on Tests run and Explanation.
